## 1) Best pizza overall?

**Prompt:**
`What do people say is the best pizza here?`

**Expected answer:**
Many reviews strongly praise the pizza quality—especially the **pepperoni** (“perfect ratio of sauce to cheese”), **wood-fired Margherita** (Naples-like, fresh basil + buffalo mozzarella), **Detroit-style** (crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior), and **thin-crust / NY-style slices** (crispy, foldable). Multiple 5-star reviews highlight consistently excellent crust and sauce balance.

---

## 2) Is it good for families / kids?

**Prompt:**
`Is this restaurant good for family night?`

**Expected answer:**
Yes. There’s a 5-star “Family night favorite” review saying they bring kids every Friday, staff make kids feel special, and they even give dough to play with. Another 4-star review mentions a “build your own quarter” option that’s great for families with picky eaters, and there’s also a 5-star kids’ party experience with dough-tossing and mini pizzas.

---

## 3) Delivery reliability?

**Prompt:**
`How is the delivery experience?`

**Expected answer:**
Delivery feedback is mixed to negative. One 2-star review reports waiting **over an hour** and pizza arriving **barely warm**. A 1-star review on Valentine’s Day says delivery took **2 hours**, was **cold**, and had **wrong toppings**. There’s also a 1-star case where the pizza arrived **upside-down** and the restaurant suggested scraping and reassembling it.

---

## 4) Hygiene / cleanliness concerns?

**Prompt:**
`Any cleanliness or food safety issues mentioned?`

**Expected answer:**
Yes. A 1-star “Dirty restaurant” review describes **sticky tables**, **dirty floors**, and an unclean-looking kitchen. Another 1-star review mentions **tomato sauce tasting rancid**, suggesting potential food safety concerns.

---

## 5) Gluten-free option?

**Prompt:**
`Do they have good gluten-free pizza?`

**Expected answer:**
Yes. A 4-star review praises their **cauliflower crust** as one of the best gluten-free options—doesn’t fall apart and tastes good, with generous toppings.

---

## 6) Vegan option?

**Prompt:**
`How is the vegan pizza?`

**Expected answer:**
Mixed. One 5-star review calls it a **hidden gem**, praising house-made **cashew cheese that melts** and fresh seasonal veggies. But another 2-star review says the vegan cheese was **grainy**, didn’t melt, and tasted strongly of **coconut**, which clashed with the sauce.

---

## 7) Best specific style: Detroit / NY / deep dish?

**Prompt:**
`Which pizza styles are praised most (NY, Detroit, deep dish)?`

**Expected answer:**
Several styles are highly praised:

* **Detroit-style**: 5-star “Amazing Detroit-style” with crispy cheese edges and fluffy interior.
* **NY-style slices**: 5-star “Perfect NY-style slices” and “Expert-level pizza folding.”
* **Chicago deep dish**: 5-star review says it’s authentic with buttery crust and proper layering, but notes a long cook time.

---

## 8) Price/value: is it expensive?

**Prompt:**
`Is it overpriced or good value?`

**Expected answer:**
Many mention it’s expensive: $24 for a medium (3-star), $30 for a large cheese (3-star), and some feel portion sizes are too small for the price (2-star “personal pizza is the size of a CD,” 2-star “absurdly small slices”). On the value side, a 4-star review praises a **lunch deal**: $10 for a 10-inch pizza + salad.

---

## 9) Too greasy?

**Prompt:**
`Are there complaints about greasy pizza?`

**Expected answer:**
Yes. Multiple reviews complain about excessive grease: “swimming in grease” (2-star), “had to blot with napkins” (2-star), and “excessive grease pooling” (2-star). There are also positive reviews praising crisp crust that avoids sogginess, so it varies by order.

---

## 10) Sauce issues?

**Prompt:**
`What do people say about the sauce?`

**Expected answer:**
Sauce opinions vary:

* Positive: excellent sauce on thin crust, perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio, sauce made from fresh tomatoes.
* Negative: “too much sauce” causing soggy crust, “sauce like ketchup” (too sweet/one-dimensional), “bland sauce,” and even “odd chemical taste” or “metallic aftertaste” mentioned in some low-rating reviews.

---

## 11) Spicy pizza warning?

**Prompt:**
`Is there any pizza that’s too spicy?`

**Expected answer:**
Yes. A 2-star review says the “Firebreather” pizza was **painfully hot**, not enjoyable, and they couldn’t taste anything else.

---

## 12) Consistency / quality control?

**Prompt:**
`Is the quality consistent?`

**Expected answer:**
Mixed. One 3-star review says it varies across visits (“amazing”, then “terrible”, then “okay”). But another 5-star “Supreme quality control” says consistency is impressive across multiple visits. So experiences conflict.

---

## 13) Best for late-night?

**Prompt:**
`Is it good for late-night food?`

**Expected answer:**
Yes. One 4-star review highlights being open **until 2am** on weekends with huge slices. Another 5-star review mentions open **until 3am** with large slices and a creative late-night menu.

---

## 14) Best for big groups / parties?

**Prompt:**
`Can we bring a big group?`

**Expected answer:**
Yes. A 5-star review says they handled a party of 12 well with large shareable pizzas and half-and-half toppings. Another 5-star review praises a party package for a group of 20 with hot on-time delivery and included supplies.

---

## 15) What should I order if I like thin crust?

**Prompt:**
`I love thin crust. What do reviews recommend?`

**Expected answer:**
Thin crust lovers strongly recommend their **cracker-thin** style (5-star “Perfect thin crust”) and **NY-style foldable slices** (multiple 5-star). Several reviews mention excellent sauce and crispness.
